To cancel an order, the Customer can (1) send an email to help@dorrbell.com (2) text or call (503) 568-1118. Orders cancelled after the shopping assistant begins the pickup process are subject to the standard delivery fee.
			</div>
			<div class="header4">Returns Policy</div>
			<div class="text_sm">
